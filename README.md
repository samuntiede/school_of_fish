# school_of_fish
Simulation of the movement of a school of fish in a shallow pool. Open Matlab, run "school_of_fish_video_make.m" and enjoy the movement of the virtual school of fish! You can change the model parameters and observe how the behaviour changes. 

In this video I explain the theory behind the method: https://youtu.be/FaWUiZEAJjY
